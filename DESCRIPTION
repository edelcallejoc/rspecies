Description: An implementation of Spatial Data Mining for Species Distribution
    Modelling. It combines Spatial Data Mining Philosophy and Bayesian Statistic
    Theory for handling large volumes of spatial data. It also implements
    Generalized Naive Bayes algorithms in order to extract useful knowledge from
    occurrence spatial information. The main goal is to use rspecies with presence/
    absence and environmental data for species distribution modelling. However, It
    can use for other modelling purposes.
